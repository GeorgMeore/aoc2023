These are my solutions to the problems from AOC 2023

This code is not expected to be read by anyone but myself,
but in case someone (for some weird reason) wants to,
I'd like to make a couple of points about how I do AOC:

1) I don't do clumsy `string.split`-kind-of parsing.
   I just convert the input to a programming-language-specific representation.
   It actually takes no more than a couple of seconds to do that with a decent editor.

2) My solutions often are not the most general ones.
   If I see a "dirty" shortcut - I take it (unless it's too dirty).
